DON'T LOSE YOUR KEY. ITS REALLY ANNOYING TO REPLACE.
To replace your key, create a temporary instance with a new key. connect your data to it. ssh into it.create a temporary folder and mount it. mount your data folder onto it and copy the authorized_key file from the temporary instance into it. Then reconnect the data to your original server.

## HTML Notes

## Git
Github is a good way to create backups and versioning for a project. I should aim to have evenly spaced commits per deliverable.

pull - gets the latest version
push - makes your code the latest version - the head
